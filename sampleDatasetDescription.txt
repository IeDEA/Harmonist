This sample dataset is provided to allow testing of the IeDEA Harmonist Data Toolkit.

The tables were constructed with random dates and fake PATIENT, PROGRAM, and CENTER variable values. 

Each table includes intentional errors to demonstrate a variety of types of possible dataset inconsistencies detected by the toolkit. 

Feel free to make your own changes to the tables and note the effect on the toolkit output.
