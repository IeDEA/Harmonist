# IeDEA Harmonist Data Toolkit

The Toolkit is a Shiny application designed to facilitate data quality checking, report generation, and file sharing within the International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA). [IeDEA](https://iedea.org) is an international consortium established in 2006 by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to provide a rich resource for globally diverse HIV/AIDS data. 

The IeDEA Cohort Consortium collaborates to collect and define key variables, harmonize data, and implement methodology to effectively pool data as a cost-effective means of generating large data sets to address the high priority research questions and streamline HIV/AIDS research. IeDEA collects HIV/AIDS data from seven international regional data centers, including four in Africa, and one each in the Asia-Pacific region, the Central/South America/Caribbean region, and North America. These regional data centers consolidate, curate and analyze data on care and treatment of HIV to evaluate the outcomes of people living with HIV/AIDS.

The [Toolkit](https://iedeadata.org/iedea-harmonist) is part of a suite of tools developed by the Harmonist Team with funding from the NIH (grant #) with the goal of harmonizing observational HIV/AIDS data. Other components of the IeDEA suite of tools include a [browsable data model](https://iedeades.org) and a secure data hub for authenticated users.

The lead developer for the IeDEA Harmonist Data Toolkit is [Judy Lewis, PhD](mailto:judy.lewis@vumc.org) (Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research) with assistance from Jeremy Stephens (Vanderbilt University Department of Biostatistics)
